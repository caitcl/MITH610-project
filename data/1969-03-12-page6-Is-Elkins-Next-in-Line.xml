<p>
<cb n="1"/>
<lb/>Now that <persName xml:id="RS">Robert Spence</persName>, <persName xml:id="BW">Bob Ward</persName>
<lb/>and <persName xml:id="FF">Frank Fellows</persName> have resigned under
<lb/>pressure from students, the next target
<lb/>is none other than the Big Man himself,
<lb/><persName xml:id="WE">Wilson Elkins</persName>.
<lb/>Though many individuals have been
<lb/>harboring a desire to see the retirement
<lb/>of our distinguished president, a col­-<lb break="no"/>­
lective effort is now under way to
<lb/>publicize <persName ref="WE">Elkins'</persName> 15-year record of un­-<lb break="no"/>­
responsiveness to students and the mani­-<lb break="no"/>­
fold problems of a growing <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName>,
<lb/><persName ref="WE">He</persName> has done much for academics and
<lb/>much for the <orgName xml:id="UMD">University’s</orgName> image, but
<lb/>all too little for the raison d’etre of this
<lb/><orgName ref="UMD">institution</orgName>--the students. Remember
<lb/>them?
<lb/><persName ref="WE">Elkins’</persName> availability is legendary, his
<lb/>morality of another age and his public
<lb/>statements a mixture of John Wayne and
<lb/>Dwight Eisenhower with a little Spiro
<lb/>Agnew thrown into the melange.
<lb/>And with the federal vindication of the
</p>
  <p>
    <cb n="2"/>
<lb/><orgName xml:id="SGA">Student Government Association’s</orgName> year­
<lb/>long declaration of institutional racism,
<lb/>further impetus has been marshalled
<lb/>behind those forces, anonymous for the
<lb/>time being, who will soon embark on a
<lb/>publicity campaign to expose <persName ref="WE">Elkins’</persName>
<lb/>uselessness here.
<lb/>Much of <persName ref="WE">Elkins’</persName> problem is not sub­-<lb break="no"/>­
stantive, but a matter of style which is
<lb/>irrelevant to the newness of modern
<lb/>life.
<lb/>In introducing Sen. <persName xml:id="EM">Edmund Muskie</persName>
<lb/>last week, <persName ref="WE">Elkins</persName> had the unfortunate
<lb/>grace to mention four times that the
<lb/><persName ref="EM">senator</persName> is a loser and that we are proud
<lb/>to have him speak here.
<lb/><persName ref="WE">Elkins</persName> noted that the length of an
<lb/>introduction is commensurate with the
<lb/>speaker’s dignity and stature. <q>“But
<lb/>this introduction will be brief,”</q> <persName ref="WE">Elkins</persName>
<lb/>faux-pased.
<lb/>Perhaps <persName ref="WE">Elkins</persName>, beset with all kinds
<lb/>of pressure from the student body, the
</p>
  <p>
    <cb n="3"/>
<lb/>legislature and from bewildered parents,
<lb/>will And it quite appealing to resign and
<lb/>return to teaching, or take a government
<lb/>position.
<lb/>Certainly his attitudes fit right in with
<lb/>the Nixon non-administration.
<lb/>The pressures of health, too, must be
<lb/>catching up with him and that would be
<lb/>as convenient an excuse as necessary to
<lb/>get oat of the College Park loony bin.
<lb/>Whenever it is that <persName ref="WE">Elkins</persName> leaves his
<lb/>beloved constituents he should remember
<lb/>that old presidents don’t die—they just
<lb/>lose their faculties.
<lb/>♦ ♦
<lb/>Speaking of presidents, the newest
<lb/>darling of the law’n’order crowd. Father
<lb/>Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame is
<lb/>reputed to have dented that the publish
<lb/>or perish syndrome exists at his campus.
<lb/>The way he put it, the problem is
<lb/><q>“Publish or back to the parish,"</q>
<lb/>Ho, ho.

Bigotry has no place
Homosexuals often face cruel predjudice. Nationally,
homosexuals and bisexuals are often the butt of cruel
jokes, pranks and assualts.
While a major hate crime against a homosexual has not
been reported on this campus recently, students are calling
for a study on campus attitudes towards homosexuality.Homosexuals are a part of this campus community.
When predjudice prevents them from being produc­
tive members of our community, the university as a
whole suffers.
Students like <persName>Steve Kalathas</persName> are calling for the creation
of an ad-hoc <orgName>Committee for Sexual Orientation and Student
Equity</orgName>. The committee would include heterosexuals and homosexuals, and would look into the way gays are treated.
<persName>Kalathas</persName> should be commended for his efforts to
disprove myths that surround homosexuality.
<persName>Kalathas'</persName> attempt to attract heterosexuals into the
fight for homosexual equality shows he is serious
about getting something done.
Some of the issues that should be explored
include homosexual rentention rates, hate crimes
and discrimination by students, staff and faculty.
It’s time for the campus to recognize the problems
that homosexuals face, research these problems and
deal with them decisively. Bigotry again.-, anyone has
no place on this campus.

    <h1>Probing the Complexities of Encoding: Meditations on using TEI and CSS on <i>Diamondback</i> articles from the 1960s </h1>
    <div id="description">
      I found this encoding exercise very challenging, in several different ways. Firstly, I constantly questioned my decisions of what and how to encode - keeping in mind the challenge Jessica Lu gave us in class, to think about how “centering blackness and black people change[s] how you engage and markup a text.” I first tried searching for <i>Diamondback</i> articles on hate crimes, since that topic aligns with a research interest of mine (namely, how university and college archives document hate crimes and other racial or sexual violence on campus, what gaps exist in this documentation, and whether and how these gaps should be addressed), but that search didn’t end up showing me any articles that explicitly mentioned black people, so I returned to the drawing board. I tried searching “institutional racism,” “black life,” “black student,” and “black student union,” and those search terms came up with much more interesting results. I ended up choosing a February 12, 1969 article entitled, <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/student-newspapers/id/f10a1eec-2825-48f8-a0ed-5fe15f7305d4?query=%22black%20student%22">“BSU outburst jolts fiery Cabinet session,”</a> and a March 12, 1969 article entitled, <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/student-newspapers/id/15ef2cfb-614e-48bf-a99a-a6fbf97db0c0">“Is Elkins next in line?”</a>

      Even though these articles were interesting to me and focused on two different areas, I am still uneasy in the search terms I used to find them. While searching on the Black Student Union (BSU) made logical sense to me, since my experience in university archives shows that student groups are often rich topics for researching sea changes on campuses, the knowledge that labeling a student as a “black student” is loaded with both useful search distinctions (for trying to locate and pull out records on black student life, civil rights, segregation, racism, and other topics) and troubling connotations that likely amplify the feelings of difference of current students of color when they encounter accounts of the university’s past and present. A quick search of the <i>Diamondback</i> archives unfiltered by date showed that “white student” retrieves 574 results, while “black student” retrieves 3619. These search results aren’t the full story, of course, but my assumption isn’t that white students are written about in the newspaper less than black students, but rather that their race is explicitly labeled less often, because being a white student is still seen as a norm at UMD. While assignments like this one attempt to challenge that norm, we are likely still reinscribing that sense of difference.

      Secondly, I wrestled with my place as the encoder - how to encode intentionally black as a white woman. I struggled with occupying a similar space in my previous job as a digital archivist at a small liberal arts college in North Carolina. One of my job duties was writing for our weekly archives blog, and I chose to focus on the history of integration at the college as a topic for two of my posts in February 2016. The first blog, <a href=”http://libraries.davidson.edu/aroundthed/thereby-hangs-a-tale-the-winding-path-to-integration-at-davidson/”>“‘Thereby Hangs a Tale’: The Winding Path to Integration at Davidson,”</a> focused on policy and attitudes at the college prior to the attendance of the first black student, and the second, <a href=”http://libraries.davidson.edu/aroundthed/it-hasnt-been-exactly-easy-early-student-reflections-on-integration-at-davidson/”>“‘It Hasn’t Been Exactly Easy’: Early Student Reflections on Integration at Davidson,”</a> focused on sharing stories of the first black students in their own words, often through mentions in the student newspaper. I wrote these two pieces more cautiously than my normal writing for the work blog - I was concerned about the reaction for the college administration and community, and wanted to make sure I had the receipts to show that I wasn’t critically fabulating these stories, that these experiences had occurred and been captured, even in a fragmented form. It turns out the community reaction, at least as expressed to me, had been entirely positive - almost two years after I originally wrote about the topic, the second blog was republished on the website of the college magazine, the <i>Davidson Journal</i>, and a new professor of Africana Studies, Garry Bertholf, has started a lecture series based off of the stories I helped uncover (particularly that of Renee Denise Fanuiel, the first black woman to graduate from Davidson College). It feels like the best possible outcome - that work I did to expose sources and stories is resulting in further research, and that that work is being led now by faculty and students of color.

      <br>
      Thirdly, I struggled with finding a balance between markup and contextual information. While reading and rereading the articles I selected, I was struck with how to communicate things like tone through markup, and whether that was possible or desirable. For instance, the “Is Elkins next in line?” article has several facetious references, jokes, and wordplay - one example is the line that “old presidents don’t die—they just lose their faculties.” The closest reference I found in the TEI Guidelines for noting jokes was using <a href=”http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-factuality.html”>“factuality,”</a> but since I didn’t consider this type of humor as delving into “describing a fictional or a non-fictional world,” I chose not to use that.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another more complicated example of tone came up in “BSU outburst jolts fiery Cabinet session,” in which the article author’s descriptions of black students set off alarm bells for me. Descriptions of the Black Student Union members “shouting,” threatening other students, and describing their action as “one of several emotional outbursts during the marathon meeting” while not mentioning tone of the white students present read as as a coded dog-whistle, attempting to reference stereotypes of “angry black men.” How should I markup things like tone policing, making the white student’s requests seem reasonable and the black students remarks’ implying violence or “unearned” anger?
      <br>
      <br>
      I could picture how to point out these differences and contextually position why describing tone differently would matter in a text accompanying the markup, but had trouble imagining how markup alone could adequately convey the complexity and layers surrounding the original newspaper text. Having an addendum would give the encoder a more easily readable space to explain why the article writer’s implicit (or explicit?) biases impact the piece, and therefore how the UMD community would understand this complicated issue. An addendum of this sort would also allow the encoder to critically fabulate missing pieces, as well as explain and link to other sources and research that could provide a fuller context. To me, markup doesn’t seem to be like a space where I can delve as deeply, but more a way of flagging certain things to make them more searchable. Ultimately, I decided to use “interp” to flag mentions of jokes and references to student tone or emotion, and styled phrases tagged with “interp” to render in red text using CSS.
      <br>
      <br>
      On a more practical note, I chose not to note corrections to OCR errors, as these didn’t seem relevant when the correction is staying accurate to the source text. I also marked up and displayed columns, paragraphs, and line breaks as they appeared in the source text. I wanted to add the URL for the digitized version of each newspaper article, in order to make the source text more visible, but had trouble figuring out where and how to do that within TEI. I ended up putting the reference in a note within the “bibl”. Similarly, one of my articles contained a photograph, which ran alongside the story. I included the caption, photographer credit, and used “figdesc” to provide a textual description of the image. I considered exposing portions of the TEI header, but ultimately decided it made the page look clunky and that users who wanted to access the TEI would be able to do so through GitHub.
      <br>
      <br>
      I encoded every personal and organization name within the text that I could identify. I also defined “blacks”/”black students” as an organization, because those words were often used to refer to a group of black students, and it was not clear what the overlap was between black students present at this particular SGA Cabinet meeting and black students who were members of the Black Student Union. My suspicion is that the article author just used “blacks” to refer to any student of color present. I made separate orgName ID’s for the Student Government Association, SGA Cabinet, and SGA Legislature - I initially thought I would tag these all under SGA, but the article text indicates that there was some sort of power struggle and disagreement between the SGA Cabinet and Legislature, and that struggle seemed to complicate the SGA Cabinet meeting that BSU members attended, so I decided to mark them as separate organizations.
